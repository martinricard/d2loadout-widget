# Widget Archive

This folder contains reference versions and working templates.

## Files:

- `widget-clean.css` - Clean CSS template (your crispy working version)
- `widget-clean.html` - Clean HTML template (if archived)

## Purpose:

These files serve as **reference versions** - the clean, working code that you provided as the baseline. They can be used as templates for future modifications or to compare against the current version.

## Key Features of Clean Version:

- ✅ No GPU acceleration tricks
- ✅ No text-rendering optimizations
- ✅ Simple, browser-native rendering
- ✅ Crisp text and images
- ✅ Weapon perks support built-in

## To Use as Template:

```powershell
# Copy clean CSS as starting point
Copy-Item "widget\archive\widget-clean.css" "widget\widget-new.css"
```

## Note:
These are your **known-good** working versions. Keep them safe! 🎯
